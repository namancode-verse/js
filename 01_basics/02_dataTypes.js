"use strict";//treat all js codes as newer version bec earlier many things were missing in js unlike today

// alert("hello")
// alert(2+4) //we are using node js ,not browser

console.log(3 +3)
console.log("hitesh")

let name="naman"
let age=38
let isLoggedIn=false

//number ==> 2 to power 53
//  big ==> for more range
//string ==> ""
// boolean ==> true/false
//null ==> its a datatype also in js and we can assign null also bec it means empty
//undefined is when no value is defined;
// symbol ==>unique
//object

console.log(typeof null)
console.log(typeof undefined)
